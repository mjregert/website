About Me

Personal
I am a husband and father of two boys. Both my wife and I are originally from Colorado, just outside of the Boulder area (near the foothills of the Rocky Mountains). We moved to Texas in 2000 after I graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in Computer Science Engineering. I am former leader with the Boy Scouts of America and love camping and outdoor photography. I have a love for music and listening vinyl records.

Professional
I am an experienced team leader and senior principal software engineer with 19 years of experience in full-stack enterprise software design and development. I have a passion for leading high-performance teams and bridging the gap between User Experience Design (UXD),  UI development and back-end engineering to create user friendly, award winning software. I love learning about new and emerging technologies and contribute to open source software.
